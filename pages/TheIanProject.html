    <p class="slideable" data-slideanim="slideLeft">Just a heads up, this post will be a lot more emotional and sappy
      then the tech based posts, although ironically this post also contains the most about computer science relative to
      the other articles as of the writing of this.</p>
    <p class="slideable" data-slideanim="slideOpacity">What causes rejection when someone asks another person out? Is it
      because they are not what that person is looking for? No, it is because they did not build a machine to do it for
      them obviously.</p>
    <p class="slideable" data-slideanim="slideRight">Around the middle of the second trimester of AP World History, I
      met someone and we knew each other on friendly terms but nothing too complicated, and eventually one conversation
      snowballed into another, until sooner or later, I had feelings for them.</p>
    <p class="slideable" data-slideanim="slideRight">Ask them out? Impossible, instead build an elaborate device that is
      full of inside jokes between us and then pull a bait and switch using an Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) that asks
      them out.</p>

    <h1 class="slideOpacity">Phase 1: Begin Prototyping and Planning</h1>
    <p class="slideable" data-slideanim="slideLeft">When I first knew I wanted to begin work on this project I figured
      EECS (Eletrical Engineering and Computer Science) was the best route to go.<br>On March 10th 2024, I finished a
      prototype for my model for the project's hardware.</p>

      on, Tinkercad doesn't have them :(<br>Take note of that joystick by the way, it costs me a lot of time later down
      the line! </i>
    <p>The current prototype for my model has an LCD display to output the text of the confession, 4 Light Emiting
      Diodes (LEDs) that will output information about the game, and the joystick that will controll the game. <br>Here
      is the software for the control.</p>

    <p>Now with a rough draft of what our hardware will look like it was time to move to the "inside joke" portion of
      the confession device, the Fabric Minecraft mod.</p>

    <h1>Phase 2: Java Programming and the Minecraft Fabric API</h1>
    <p>Whenever I decide to make a Minecraft mod my typically go to pick is Fabric, a modding API. I started the
      Minecraft portion at <a href="https://fabricmc.net/develop/template/">this address</a> which made creating all of
      the boilerplate easy.<br>After a long brain storming session with my friend, Netherbacon who helped me build the
      map, we came up with 4 simple puzzles to be done in Minecraft.</p>
    <p>The concepts were
    <ul>
      <li>Green Room: Zombie Burning Time Limit</li>
      <li>Blue Room: Binary Decoding</li>
      <li>Red Room: Simon Says</li>
      <li>Yellow Room: Inside Joke about Crafting a Meal</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I won't go over all of the Java in the mod for there is a lot; however, I can describe the Fabric workflow and
      some example files. <a href="https://github.com/spooketti/ConfessionDevice"></a></p>

    <p>Fabric requires items to be registiered which can be acomplished with</p>
    <pre><code class="java">Registry.register(Registries.ITEM, new Identifier("parent", "id"), ITEM);</code></pre>

    <h2>Green Puzzle</h2>
    <p>So the plan as of now for the zombie, is just to spawn a zombie in
      a set coordinate that prevents them from leaving, and increase their health so they have more time to burn, as
      when they die from the burning, the puzzle is failed.<br>The plan now is simple. Create an item that spawns
      the zombie, set the coordinate, and modify the health. Then if a zombie already exists within the coordinates,
      kill them.</p>
    <pre><code class="java">
        //this only contains the spawning code, and world is from the TypedActionResult&lt;ItemStack&gt; use(World world)
        zombie = new ZombieEntity(world);
        zombie.setPosition(11.5, -58, -15.5);
        zombie.setCustomName(Text.of("死"));
        zombie.getAttributeInstance(EntityAttributes.GENERIC_MAX_HEALTH).setBaseValue(300.0f);
        zombie.setHealth(50.0f);
        world.spawnEntity(zombie);
     </code></pre>
    <p>However; right now there is no practical way to check for death in the item itself, so the solution is to use a Mixin, or a
      injection into the onDeath method.</p>
    <pre><code>
@Mixin(LivingEntity.class)
public class ZombieDie {
	@Inject(at = @At("HEAD"), method = "onDeath")
	private void onDeath(DamageSource source, CallbackInfo info) {
		LivingEntity entity = (LivingEntity)(Object) this;
		try {
			System.out.println(entity.getCustomName().getLiteralString());
			if(entity.getCustomName().getLiteralString().equals("死"))
			{
				SerialStatus.greenComplete = false;
				SerialStatus.redComplete = false;
				SerialStatus.blueComplete = false;
				SerialStatus.yellowComplete = false;
				Simon.resetSimon();
				
			}
			
		} catch (Exception e) 
		{

		}
	}
}
      </code></pre>
    <p>This script injects into the head or start of the onDeath method and checks if the entity name was correct, and
      then if so it fails the puzzle: handled by SerialStatus. If you are truely interested in how this mod works, the
      rest of the source code is pubically available here on <a
        href="https://github.com/spooketti/ConfessionDevice">GitHub</a></p>

    <h1>Phase 3: Hardware Faults and Hardship</h1>
    <p>The method I was using to communicate the progress of the game was via serial data on port COM3.
      The library I was using, Java Simple Serial Connector (JSSC) often wasn't able to write its bytes to the
      Arduino correctly or would have trouble with the port either being closed or busy.<br>
      Another example of these difficulties would be in the LEDs shining not as brightly in real life or them burning
      out.
      One possible causation of this could be either faulty wiring or a lack of a resistor
      despite the digital pins operating at 3.3V. <br>
      I know this was not a software fault as the same code was copy and pasted into Tinkercad and it worked perfectly
      in simulation.

    <h1>Phase 3.5: Outside Views</h1>
    <p>Remember when I said there was secrecy, well this is where it comes from.</p>
    <img src="../assets/images/confession/fulliberg.png" style="width:30%">
    <p>This was made by my friend who was practicing forensics for a CTF, and found all of that info just through my
      Discord profile connections.<br>
      Near the bottom it says the IanProject and who Ian is (lil' Ian), so for a long time people speculated on what it could be. I suppose if
      you're one of them reading this, now you know.</p>
    <img src="../assets/images/confession/iceberg.png" style="width:30%">

    <h1>Phase 4: Finale</h1>
    <p>Now that the project is concluded the code name of the SecretProjectForIan, is no longer so secret anymore.</p>
    <img src="../assets/images/confession/rename.png">
    <p>I'm excited to see where things go from here, and had fun interacting with the Fabric framework again.</p>
